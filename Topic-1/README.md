MavenTest

In this project i created a not so simple unit test with a modified pom.xml file which contains all the dependences i needed to
complete this project.
i also added a skipping test configuration via pom.xml
i ran the tests and the build was succesfull just like the skipping test part.
installing maven in my pc was the most difficult part.
