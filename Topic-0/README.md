bootcamp practice 2016

This is a practice of design patterns.
three of them are creational patterns such as Singleton, abstract factory and builder designs and one is a structural pattern such as
proxy pattern.
In this examples i'm creating a simulation of a data base connection for every design pattern.
each pattern has his own way to connect to a data base.
